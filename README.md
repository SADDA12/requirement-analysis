# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for a simulated requirement analysis project. 

The goal of this project is to apply real-world software development practices by performing a detailed requirement analysis for a booking management system. 

Key objectives include:
- Understanding and applying the principles of requirement analysis in the SDLC.
- Identifying and categorizing functional and non-functional requirements.
- Creating use case diagrams to visualize system interactions.
- Defining clear and measurable acceptance criteria.

Each task in this project builds toward a comprehensive blueprint that supports efficient software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, goals, and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process ensures that developers and all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do and how it should behave.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Shared Understanding:** It eliminates ambiguity by clearly defining what the software must achieve.
- **Defines Scope:** Helps establish the boundaries of the project, minimizing scope creep and misaligned expectations.
- **Foundation for Design and Development:** Serves as a blueprint for building the software, influencing architecture, design decisions, and user experience.
- **Enables Accurate Planning:** Facilitates realistic estimates for cost, time, and resources.
- **Improves Quality:** Ensures the final product aligns with user needs, increasing satisfaction and reducing costly changes later.

By thoroughly analyzing and documenting requirements, teams can reduce errors, manage risks, and deliver solutions that solve the right problems effectively.
