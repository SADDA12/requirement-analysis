# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for a simulated requirement analysis project. 

The goal of this project is to apply real-world software development practices by performing a detailed requirement analysis for a booking management system. 

Key objectives include:
- Understanding and applying the principles of requirement analysis in the SDLC.
- Identifying and categorizing functional and non-functional requirements.
- Creating use case diagrams to visualize system interactions.
- Defining clear and measurable acceptance criteria.

Each task in this project builds toward a comprehensive blueprint that supports efficient software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, goals, and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process ensures that developers and all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do and how it should behave.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Shared Understanding:** It eliminates ambiguity by clearly defining what the software must achieve.
- **Defines Scope:** Helps establish the boundaries of the project, minimizing scope creep and misaligned expectations.
- **Foundation for Design and Development:** Serves as a blueprint for building the software, influencing architecture, design decisions, and user experience.
- **Enables Accurate Planning:** Facilitates realistic estimates for cost, time, and resources.
- **Improves Quality:** Ensures the final product aligns with user needs, increasing satisfaction and reducing costly changes later.

By thoroughly analyzing and documenting requirements, teams can reduce errors, manage risks, and deliver solutions that solve the right problems effectively.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for building software that meets user needs and business goals. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Reduces Miscommunication and Ambiguity**
   By clearly defining what the system should do, Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders—developers, designers, testers, and clients—have a shared understanding of the project goals. This minimizes misunderstandings that can lead to costly rework.

2. **Enables Better Planning and Estimation**
   A well-analyzed set of requirements allows teams to make accurate estimates for project timelines, budgets, and resources. This helps in setting realistic expectations and managing project scope effectively.

3. **Improves Software Quality**
   With well-documented and validated requirements, development teams can build software that aligns with user needs. This increases the chances of delivering a product that is functional, usable, and reliable, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction.

Requirement Analysis sets the tone for the entire development process, ensuring that the project starts with clarity, focus, and direction.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help define what the software system should do and how it should behave. Here are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  - Conduct interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders.
  - Observe user environments to understand pain points and expectations.
  - Analyze existing documentation or systems to identify improvement areas.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  - Refine and expand the gathered data through brainstorming and focus groups.
  - Use prototyping to help stakeholders visualize the system and provide feedback.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  - Create detailed documents like the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
  - Develop user stories and use cases to capture system functionality from the user’s perspective.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  - Prioritize requirements based on business impact and feasibility.
  - Use diagrams (like data flow diagrams and entity-relationship models) to visualize system requirements.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  - Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  - Define acceptance criteria and build a traceability matrix to link each requirement to corresponding tests and deliverables.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly classified into two categories: Functional and Non-functional requirements. Both are essential for building a robust and user-friendly system.

### Functional Requirements 

Functional requirements describe **what** the system should do. These are the core features and interactions that users expect from the system. For a booking management system, some key functional requirements include:

- **Search Properties**: Users can search for available properties based on location, price range, and availability.
- **User Registration**: Users can create an account with their personal information and login credentials.
- **Property Listings**: The system should display property details including images, pricing, location, and availability.
- **Booking System**: Users can select available dates, confirm bookings, and manage their reservations.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration flow to protect user accounts.

### Non-functional Requirements 

Non-functional requirements define **how** the system should perform. These attributes impact user experience, performance, and system behavior under specific conditions. For the booking management system, important non-functional requirements include:

- **Performance**: The application should load all major pages within 2 seconds and support up to 1000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Ensure secure data handling using encryption, secure login protocols, and protection against vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle an increase in user traffic.
- **Usability**: Interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, suitable for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Reliability**: The platform must maintain 99.9% uptime and recover quickly from system failures.
