# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for a simulated requirement analysis project. 

The goal of this project is to apply real-world software development practices by performing a detailed requirement analysis for a booking management system. 

Key objectives include:
- Understanding and applying the principles of requirement analysis in the SDLC.
- Identifying and categorizing functional and non-functional requirements.
- Creating use case diagrams to visualize system interactions.
- Defining clear and measurable acceptance criteria.

Each task in this project builds toward a comprehensive blueprint that supports efficient software development.
